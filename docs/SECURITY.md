# Security Policy

We take the security and integrity of uakronsec very seriously. If you have found a vulnerability, please report it ASAP so we can quickly remediate the issue.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

For vulnerabilities that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of uakronsec services, please send your disclosure via email to uakronsecadmins@uakron.edu. Include as much detail as possible to ensure reproducibility. At a minimum, vulnerability disclosures should include:

- Vulnerability Description

- Impact
- Screenshots or Proof

### Submission Guidelines

Do not engage in activities that might cause a denial of service condition, create significant strains on critical resources, or negatively impact users of the site outside of test accounts.
