# Contributing Guidelines
The following documentation serves as a guideline for contribution to [uakronsec](https://github.com/avrha/uakronsec). Email any additional questions or concerns at uakronsecadmins@uakron.edu. 

## Pull Requests
The main branch of [uakronsec](https://github.com/avrha/uakronsec) is secured to prevent unauthorized changes. To contribute, fork the repository and create an unprotected branch for development. The forked repository will act as a pull request when submitting any contributions. When documenting a request, please be clear and concise. Explain what your code fixes or adds. No need to over explain, keep it clean and simple.

## Clean Code and Good Comments 
We're not too crazy about coding guidelines, just make sure what you write can be understood by others. Name variables, functions, classes, etc in a reasonable manner so developers can understand their meaning. Document your code with effective comments. Not every line needs to be talked about, but code without any input from the programmer is more difficult to read.

##  Repository Structure
An organized repository is a clean repository. To prevent any clutter or confusion, a guideline for structuring files and folders is enforced. File creation or modification is to be done in their respective folder. For example, creating/modifying a navbar in html is done in the html folder. The exception to the rule are the main html and documentation files, they belong outside of all the sub folders.
